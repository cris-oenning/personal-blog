# Personal Blog:

This project consists of a simple personal blog developed using the React.js library and the react-router-dom library for managing scales. The application aims to allow the publication of posts and user access to these posts in an organized and intuitive way.

Through React.js, components that make up the user interface were created, such as the display of posts, categories and the homepage. The react-router-dom library was used to define the application's routes, such as the home page, category page and individual post page.

By using react-router-dom, links were created for navigation between the different pages of the application and ensure that the user always has access to the desired information in an organized and intuitive way.

The project can be easily run in any development environment using the npm start or yarn start commands. With this, it is possible to access the personal blog through a web browser and view the posts in an easy and intuitive way.
